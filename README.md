# FAST: Fast and Safe Teleportation System

## Description

In this group project, we ventured into an exciting post-apocalyptic world where humanity, after centuries of living on Mars and massive spaceships, returned to Earth to rebuild civilization from the ground up. The first colony, Adria, was established, and our mission was to innovate a groundbreaking solution that would transform life for the Adrians and future human colonies. With technology reset to a blank slate, we had the unique opportunity to think creatively and explore a wide range of possibilities, from advanced agricultural systems to sustainable energy sources. The only limits we faced were our imagination and our ability to effectively defend our ideas to potential investors.

Our team conceived a groundbreaking solution called **FAST**, a fast and safe teleportation system designed to revolutionize travel across Adria. The vision was to install teleporters strategically throughout the colony, enabling residents to move quickly and securely between various locations. Users would be able to select nearby teleporters and discover the most efficient routes for their journeys. 

In addition to basic teleportation capabilities, the system featured advanced functionalities, such as the ability to manage a friend list, create groups for group teleportation, and control personal home teleporters. Users could customize their teleportation experience with settings like whitelisting and blacklisting individuals, as well as scheduling availability for their teleporters. This innovative approach not only enhanced convenience and safety for the inhabitants of Adria but also fostered a sense of community and connectivity within the colony.

Although this project was not primarily focused on programming, we were fortunate to have the opportunity to build a prototype of the FAST system. We developed an interactive map that allowed users to select teleporters, manage travel plans, and customize their teleporters' features. This prototype served as a compelling user interface demonstration for potential investors, showcasing the innovative capabilities of our teleportation system. To effectively pitch FAST as a viable business concept to a jury of industry experts, we adopted an entrepreneurial mindset, carefully crafting our presentation to highlight the unique benefits and market potential of our solution.

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me immerse myself in Reactâ€™s component-based architecture and state management, which allowed me to build a responsive and intuitive user interface. Despite the challenge of learning React on the fly, it was an ideal opportunity to expand my skill set and push my boundaries as a developer. Ultimately, we successfully delivered a sleek and fully functional prototype that effectively demonstrated how users could navigate and control their teleportation experience through FAST.
